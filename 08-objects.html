  this makes javascript more efficeint.*/

   when you compare their values as equals you get false. this is because
   even though the objects are identical their variables aren't storing 
   the object it's self rather it's pointing to where that object is stored 
   thus both objects are stored seprate, & their respective variables refrence them individually*/
